attributes of a defined class are called automatically white the functions might not get called
Everything in Python is a class, all the lists or arrays or variables or data structures are all classes hence Python is called Object Oriented Programming Language
In modular programming, "from" is used to mention the file and "import" used for name of class to import.
.super() is used inside child class to allow accessing parent calss attributes and child class attributes on the top of that.
